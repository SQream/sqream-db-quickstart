# SQream DB Quickstart
This tutorial uses ClientCmd, the SQream DB command line client, to introduce key concepts and tasks, including:
* Creating a database, creating tables
* Loading CSV data into tables
* Querying
* Basic monitoring

Note: ClientCmd, the SQL client, is distrubted with SQream DB, so nothing extra is needed.
